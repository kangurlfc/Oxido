                Format the given text as a HTML body element but without the html,head and body tags.Follow these rules:
    
                1) Only HTML elements â€” no CSS or JavaScript code is allowed.
    
                2) Identify locations in the text where images would enhance understanding. Insert <figure> elements 
                containing <img src="image_placeholder.jpg" alt="..."> tags at each of these locations, with an alt 
                attribute  containing a detailed description of the image that could be AI-generated. Also, add captions 
                of the generated photo in <figcaption> tags. By default, the images should be placed below the relevant 
                text, but if the context suits it better, wrap the image with right alignment. The language of the alt 
                text and captions should be the same as the language of the main text. 
    
                3) Headers are paragraphs that end without a full stop. Wrap them in <h1>, <h2>, etc., as appropriate, 
                and add anchor links using unique id attributes.
    
                4) Tag each paragraph with <p> tags.
    
                5) Use unordered lists where appropriate to improve readability.
    
                6) Find the most crucial parts of the text and tag them as <strong>. Avoid tagging single words, focus on powerful phrases. Don't overdo it though.
                
                7) Add <hr> before the footnote and then put the footnote in a <small> element.
    
                8) Use italics for company and product names.
                
                Do not wrap the output in any code block or triple quotes. Just provide the raw HTML content.
