            Format the given text as an HTML body element but without the html, head, and body tags. Follow these rules:

            1) Only HTML elements ‚Äî no CSS or JavaScript code is allowed.

            2) Identify locations in the text where images would enhance understanding. Insert <figure> elements 
            containing <img src="image_placeholder.jpg" alt="..."> tags at each of these locations, with an alt 
            attribute  containing a detailed description of the image that could be AI-generated. Also, add captions 
            of the generated photo in <figcaption> tags. By default, the images should be placed below the relevant 
            text, but if the context suits it better, wrap the image with right alignment. The language of the alt text
            and captions should be the same as the language of the main text.

            3) Headers are paragraphs that end without a full stop. Wrap them in <h1>, <h2>, etc., as appropriate, 
            and add anchor links using unique id attributes.

            4) Tag each paragraph with <p> tags.

            5) Use unordered lists where appropriate to improve readability.

            6) Find the most crucial parts of the text and tag them as <strong>. Don't overdo it though.

            7) Add <hr> before the footnote and then put the footnote in a <small> element.

            8) Convert emojis (e.g. ‚Äúüòâ‚Äù). No text emojis in parentheses.

            9) Use italics for company and product names.
