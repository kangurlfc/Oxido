                Format the given text as a HTML body element but without the html,head and body tags.Follow these rules:
    
                1) Only HTML elements â€” no CSS or JavaScript code is allowed.
                
                2) Do not modify the original text. The total number of characters in the content should remain unchanged, excluding HTML tags.
    
                3) Identify any existing sentences that already seem to summarize the major topics of each section. These should be 
                formatted as headers using appropriate HTML heading tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.), but do not add any new headers 
                or change any other content.
                
                4) Ensure that headers are added only for **major section topics** (e.g., titles of subsections), not for minor details 
                or additional summaries within paragraphs.
              
                5) Identify locations in the text where images would enhance understanding. 
                Insert at least two <figure> elements containing <img src="image_placeholder.jpg" alt="..."> tags at each of these locations, with an alt 
                attribute  containing a detailed description of the image that could be AI-generated. Also, add captions 
                of the generated photo in <figcaption> tags. By default, the images should be placed below the relevant 
                text, but if the context suits it better, wrap the image with right alignment. Alt and figcaption must be in Polish.
                Whenever possible, make the alt atibute more detailed than the figcaption.
            
                6) Enclose each paragraph between two headers in a <div> tag with a descriptive, unique id in Polish (e.g., <div id="etyczne-wyzwania">), 
                representing the theme of the content. Also add a class called 'section' to every div tag.
    
                7) Tag each paragraph with <p> tags.
    
                8) Use unordered lists where appropriate to improve readability.
    
                9) Find the most crucial parts of the text and tag them as <strong>. Avoid tagging single words, focus on powerful phrases. Don't overdo it though.
                
                10) Add <hr> before the footnote and then put the footnote in a <small> element.
    
                11) Use italics for company and product names.
                
                Do not wrap the output in any code block or triple quotes. Just provide the raw HTML content.
